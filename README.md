# BarrelControl
When aiming, it is best to control the angle at the tip, rather than the angle at the base. This model examples how one might accomplish this.

1) Continous model for barrel with shape functions
2) Implemented controller
3) No sensor dynamics
4) Online Visualization
5) Kalman filter for tip angle estimation
